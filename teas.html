            <h1>Black Tea</h1>
            <p>Black Tea is a fully oxidised tea. English Breakfast and Earl Grey are two common types of black tea savoured in the U.K. Non-perfumed, natural black tea tends to offer a malty, full-bodied liquor with rich flavours varying from fruity, chocolaty, woody and spicy notes. Most of black teas are grown in China, India, Sri Lanka and Kenya. South Korea and Taiwan also have a limited production of high quality, artisan, black teas. </p>

        <div id="oolongTea" class="teas">
            <h1>Ooolong Tea</h1>
            <p>Oolong Tea is a semi-oxidised tea, with a varying degree of oxidation between 10 - 80%. Depending on the oxidation level, the aromas and flavours can vary from floral, tropical fruit notes to toasty, smoky, woody notes. Oolong teas come in various shapes such small pellets or rolled into spiral shapes. The most celebrated oolong teas are produced in Taiwan and China.</p>

        <div id="greenTea" class="teas">
            <h1>Green Tea</h1>
            <p>Green Tea is an unoxidised tea -  once tea leaves are plucked, they are steamed or pan-fired to stop further oxidation. Green teas come in various shapes such as flat-needle like, curled or rolled into balls. Japanese green teas tend to offer umami and cooked vegetal (spinach) notes, whereas Chinese and Taiwanese green teas offer more toasty, floral or fruity flavours. Korean green teas such as Joongjak and Sejak illustrate the characteristics of both Japanese and Chinese green teas.</p>

        <div id="yellowTea" class="teas">
            <h1>Yellow Tea</h1>
            <p>Yellow Tea is only produced in Hunan and Sichuan Province in China. Undergoing a unique "Men Hwang" process, which allows a slight oxidation on the tea leaves, yellow tea illustrates a flavour profile similar to green tea, but with more pronounced fruity and floral notes. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="whiteTea" class="teas">
            <h1>White Tea</h1>
            <p>White Tea is the least processed tea of all teas - once tea leaves are plucked, they are withered in the sun and dried. Especially, white teas made from downy buds such as Silver Needle contain a high level of antioxidants such as catechin and polyphenols that help boost your immune system. </p>

        <div id="fermentedTea" class="teas">
            <h1>Fermented Tea</h1>
            <p>Originating from Yunnan Province, China, the birthplace of tea, Puerh tea goes through a post-fermentation process, from which it develops its unique earthy and leathery flavours. Aged puerh tea develops more complex flavours and are highly sought-after by tea connoisseurs. In China, Puerh tea is believed to aid digestion and weight loss and often accompanied during a greasy meal. </p>
